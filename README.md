# Analysis-on-Udemy-Courses
INFORMATIONAL REPORT ON UDEMY COURSES.
Introduction:
This project is based on a dataset to provide insights into courses on Udemy, to know the courses and levels people subscribe and their payment metrics. 
Project Description:
The dataset contains of 12 columns with 3,678 rows with 10 variables. These variables include the course-id, course-title, the URL of the course, the number of subscribers, number of reviews, total lectures, content- duration and the payment metrics. The data collected spanned a 7-year period from the time the course was published on Udemy from year 2011 to year 2017. After loading the data into Power BI Desktop, certain questions were derived from the variables which help me to achieve my goals. 
These Questions Includes:
1.Which subject generate the most revenue?
2.The level which has most subscribers and reviews?
3.What are the total lectures on each subject?
4.Which year was most subject published?
5.Does the payment metric affect courses?
The Goal:
This project seeks to bring to light the subject that generate more revenues and the level learners subscribe to. Also, helps educators to know the courses to upload on the Udemy app, which subject has the most reviews.  Finally, the level that payment metrics affects. 
Data Design Process:
1.Data Exploration and Cleaning. 
The dataset was explored on power Query to inspect the columns and rows closely. The course-id was changed to text, deleted the URL since it wonâ€™t have any effects on the analysis. The price was changed to currency and date type to date only. A new column was created to calculate the total revenue by multiplying the price column and subscribers column.
2.Data Analysis Overview and Visualization.
Power BI was the tool used to create report for analysis and Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) was used to create certain measures to enhance its visualization. 
3.Analysis on the Visualization.
The total courses on Udemy was 3,678 with 4 subjects and 4 levels. 
There was an upward increase in uoloading of courses from 2011 to 2016, and dropped off to  2017
The total revenue generated across all subject was 884.68M with Web development being the highest, followed by business finance, graphic design and lastly music instruments.
It was observed that, all levels take the most subscribers as learners enjoyed subject that has everything inclusive.
Educators should upload courses that cut across all levels and web development on Udemy. 
More free access should be given to beginner levels, as when people take the beginner course, they will pay for the other levels when completed.
